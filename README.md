# TopDownGML
A proof of concept for top down games in GM:S 2

# Development Log
This is temporary, I'll find a better place later
- 12/28/16: Initial project started.  Upgraded to GM:S 2 and started working on an input controller
- 12/29/16: Added a small 2D vector library with basic functions.  Made the game delta_time based.  Finished input controller to support fully rebindable keys and the possibility for gamepad controls with analog sticks.  Implemented basic movement.
- 12/31/15: Switched to physics based movement.  The player now has momentum and a bit of inertia.  Movement feels more clean and natural.  Added basic jumping, sprinting, and sneaking.
